Horne, preacher of the gospel at South-Lin in Norfolke. Which charge was managed and made good by him against George Whitehead, in the chancel of South-Lin, before some hundreds of people, Jan. 13. 1659. to the great baffling of the said George Whitehead and his party, through the merciful and gracious hand of the Lord appearing for his truth and servants therein, as is known to, and witnessed by the generality of the audience of understanding.
